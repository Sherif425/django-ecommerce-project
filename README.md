# üß© Capstone Project - Part 3: Implementation Phase

### Project Title: E-commerce Product API

**Student Name:** Sherif Mohamed
**Phase:** Part 3 ‚Äì Building the Backend
**Date:** October 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

This phase focuses on the **implementation** of the E-commerce Product API.
Following the planning and design phases (Part 1 and 2), I have now set up the Django project, created core applications, implemented the primary API endpoints, and started integrating authentication and search functionalities.

The main goal during this stage was to **get the core backend functional**, following the ERD and API design created earlier.

---

## 2. What I Built in This Phase

### 2.1 Project Setup

* Created a new Django project named **`ecommerce_backend`**.
* Created two Django apps:

  * **`users`** ‚Äî for user management and authentication.
  * **`products`** ‚Äî for product and category management.
* Installed and configured **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.
* Set up the database using Django ORM (SQLite for local testing).
* Created `.env` file to store environment variables securely (e.g., secret key, debug mode).

**Key Packages Installed:**

```
Django==5.x
djangorestframework==3.x
djangorestframework-simplejwt==5.x
python-decouple==3.x
```

---

### 2.2 Models Implemented

#### **Category Model**

* Fields: `name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
* Purpose: Organizes products into categories.

#### **Product Model**

* Fields: `name`, `description`, `price`, `stock_quantity`, `image_url`, `category`, `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `in_stock`.
* Relationships:

  * Foreign key to **Category**.
  * Foreign key to **User** (created_by).
* Implemented automatic field validations:

  * Price must be positive.
  * Stock quantity must be zero or greater.

#### **User Model**

* Used Django‚Äôs built-in **User** model for simplicity.
* Integrated **JWT authentication** using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`.

---

### 2.3 Serializers Implemented

* **CategorySerializer:** Handles CRUD operations for categories.
* **ProductSerializer:** Handles all product-related operations including validation and nested category data.
* **UserSerializer:** Manages user registration and profile serialization.

Each serializer ensures:

* Data validation (name, price, stock quantity required).
* Nested category output for product listings.

---

### 2.4 Views and Endpoints Implemented

Using **ViewSets** and **Routers** for clean, RESTful endpoints.

#### ‚úÖ **Product Endpoints**

| Endpoint                              | Method      | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/products/`                      | GET         | List all products (with pagination & filtering) |
| `/api/products/`                      | POST        | Create a new product (admin only)               |
| `/api/products/<int:id>/`             | GET         | Retrieve a single product                       |
| `/api/products/<int:id>/`             | PUT / PATCH | Update a product (admin only)                   |
| `/api/products/<int:id>/`             | DELETE      | Delete a product (admin only)                   |
| `/api/products/search/?q=<name>`      | GET         | Search for products by name                     |
| `/api/products/filter/?category=<id>` | GET         | Filter products by category                     |

#### ‚úÖ **Category Endpoints**

| Endpoint                    | Method       | Description                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `/api/categories/`          | GET          | List all categories          |
| `/api/categories/`          | POST         | Create category (admin only) |
| `/api/categories/<int:id>/` | PUT / DELETE | Update/Delete (admin only)   |

#### ‚úÖ **User Endpoints**

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                   |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/api/users/register/` | POST   | Create a new user             |
| `/api/users/token/`    | POST   | Login (JWT Token)             |
| `/api/users/profile/`  | GET    | Get user info (auth required) |

---

### 2.5 Authentication and Permissions

* Integrated **JWT Authentication** (JSON Web Tokens).
* Configured permissions:

  * Anonymous users ‚Üí can **view** products and categories.
  * Authenticated admin users ‚Üí can **create, update, or delete** products/categories.

DRF `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` and custom permissions were used.

---

### 2.6 Product Search & Filtering

Implemented search and filtering using DRF‚Äôs **SearchFilter** and **DjangoFilterBackend**.

**Examples:**

* `/api/products/search/?q=mouse` ‚Üí returns all products with "mouse" in their name.
* `/api/products/filter/?category=2` ‚Üí returns all products in category 2.
* `/api/products/?min_price=50&max_price=200` ‚Üí (future enhancement) price range filtering.

Pagination (default: 10 items per page) added via DRF settings:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10
}
```

---

### 2.7 Testing

* Tested all endpoints with **Postman**.
* Verified CRUD operations, authentication, and filtering behavior.
* Added unit tests for:

  * Product creation and retrieval.
  * Category creation and listing.
  * JWT authentication token generation.

## 3. Challenges Faced and How I Solved Them

| Challenge                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication Setup (JWT)**              | Initially faced token decoding issues; resolved by properly configuring `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings and using `SimpleJWT` views for login/logout. |
| **Search & Filtering Logic**                | Search worked partially; refined it using DRF‚Äôs `SearchFilter` and custom query parameters for flexibility.                                     |
| **Admin-Only Restrictions**                 | Added custom permission class checking `request.user.is_staff`.                                                                                 |
| **Deployment Prep (Heroku/PythonAnywhere)** | Configured `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, created `Procfile`, and added `gunicorn` to requirements for smooth deployment.                                     |

---

## 4. Next Steps (for Part 4)

In the next phase, I will:

1. **Finalize Deployment** on **Heroku** (or **PythonAnywhere**) with database configuration.
2. **Add README.md** to GitHub explaining project setup, API usage, and endpoint documentation.
3. **Implement advanced filters** for price range and stock availability.
4. **Add image upload functionality** (via DRF‚Äôs `ImageField` or Cloudinary integration).
5. **Enhance test coverage** and improve error handling.

## 6. Summary

This phase successfully laid the foundation of the E-commerce Product API.
All core components ‚Äî models, serializers, viewsets, authentication, and product search ‚Äî have been implemented and tested locally.
The API now provides a working backend that adheres to RESTful design principles and is ready for deployment and scaling.
