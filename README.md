# üß© Capstone Project - Design Phase

## 1. Introduction

This document continues from **Part 1: The Idea and Planning Phase** of the Capstone Project.
In Part 1, I defined the project concept, features, database plan, and development timeline.
In this **Design Phase**, I present:

* The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, showing how data will be structured and related.
* A detailed list of the **API endpoints** that will form the backbone of the application.

These will serve as the blueprint for the implementation phase (Part 3).

## 2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### 2.1 Overview

The E-commerce Product API consists of three core entities:

1. **User** ‚Äî represents store administrators and registered users (leveraging Django‚Äôs built-in `User` model).
2. **Category** ‚Äî represents product categories such as ‚ÄúElectronics,‚Äù ‚ÄúClothing,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBooks.‚Äù
3. **Product** ‚Äî represents individual products listed in the store.

The **relationships** are:

* Each **Product** belongs to **one Category** (One-to-Many).
* Each **Category** can have **multiple Products**.
* Each **Product** is **created by a User** (admin), establishing a link between users and products.

### 2.2 ERD Diagram

*(You will upload your ERD image here once you draw it using draw.io, Miro, or dbdiagram.io.)*

Here‚Äôs how the structure should look conceptually:

```
+-----------------+          1        +------------------+
|     Category    |------------------<|     Product      |
+-----------------+                   +------------------+
| id (PK)         |                   | id (PK)          |

| updated_at      |                   | price            |
+-----------------+                   | in_stock (bool)  |
                                      | category_id (FK) |
                                      | created_by (FK)  |
                                      | created_at       |
                                      | updated_at       |
                                      +------------------+
                                                ^
                                                |
                                                | Many
                                                |
                                          +-------------+
                                          |    User     |
                                          +-------------+
                                          | id (PK)     |
                                          | username     |
                                          | email        |
                                          | password     |
                                          | is_staff     |
                                          +-------------+
```

## 3. API Endpoints Design

### 3.1 Overview

The API will follow **RESTful principles**, using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.
Endpoints are grouped by functionality ‚Äî **User Management**, **Category Management**, and **Product Management**.

All endpoints will return **JSON responses**.

---

### 3.2 Authentication

* **Authentication Type:** Token Authentication
* **Permissions:**

  * Authenticated admin users can create, update, and delete.
  * Anonymous users can only view products and categories.

---

    "description": "A high-quality ergonomic mouse",
    "price": 29.99,
    "in_stock": true,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "created_by": "admin"
  }

## 4. Design Considerations

1. **Modular Structure**:

   * `users` app ‚Üí manages registration, login, and authentication.
   * `products` app ‚Üí manages products and categories.
2. **Security**:

   * Token authentication for all modifying operations.
3. **Scalability**:

   * Clear separation of concerns allows for adding more features later (e.g., orders, carts).
4. **Reusability**:

   * DRF `ModelViewSet` and routers simplify CRUD operations.
